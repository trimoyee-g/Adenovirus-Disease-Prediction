- The project aims to develop a machine learning model using scikit-learn for early detection of Adenovirus disease using individual bodily parameters.
- Explored and compared various models, including DecisionTreeClassifier, KNN, Logistic Regression, etc.
- Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics for comprehensive performance analysis.
- Identified the most effective model, considering a balance between overall accuracy and sensitivity to true positives.
- The project contributes to improved decision-making in healthcare.
